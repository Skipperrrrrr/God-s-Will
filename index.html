  <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 20px auto; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;">
    We met in the university. We were both 17. I was in second year and she was a fresher. We met because we were supposed to start a Bacenta on campus together. I mean we started the Bacenta 😅 but as we kept the fellowship going on our hearts grew fonder 🥹❤️.
    Before we knew it, I enjoyed spending more time with her than even my books😭. Unreasonable but magical💕. It wasn’t typically love at first sight but I love how long it took for you to start telling me “I haven’t heard from you the whole day”.
    Every day for four years, I thought about you, I came to your room, I ate your food, I tried to make you laugh😅 and I laughed at you even more only to realize that I had melted to the ground; fallen so much in love no one could pick me up.
    On the 5th of July, 2022, I popped the question (not the biggest one but the phrase still works😂😂). Fast forward, it’s been three years and I still really like you. I imagine what happy ever after with you will be like and teaching our 18 year old child how to drive and I imagine what “Kwaku and Lorrie’s 50th anniversary would be and I know only one person I see myself doing this with; YOU.
    <br><br>
    I remember one fun memory; we went to Hillview hotel to just sit and chill. We were well aware that bringing food from outside wasn’t allowed but we came in confidently with our Waakye😂 and found a way to eat it in plain sight.
    At every point I was very worried that we’d get caught but I was encouraging you to feel free and eat😂😂😂. The only thing we did right was to buy coke and lime from them to give them the assurance that we were with them. I loved doing that with you.
    <br><br>
    I’ll forever laugh at your English even though technically you understand and know way more words than I do😭😂😂.

  <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 20px auto; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;">
    I want to go on trips with you all around the world — especially to the tropical places you love: Zanzibar, Korea, Brazil, the US, Maldives, Santorini, Bermuda island, Jamaica, the Caribbeans, and last but not least, Switzerland.
    <br><br>
    I see a happy marriage because I chose to be with you and no one else, and I want you to know I’d choose you even if you were a twin.
    <br><br>
    I see a home with you as our spiritual covering, teaching our kids to love the Lord and serve Him — where you're your husband’s biggest support.
    <br><br>
    A home with our twins, Nyameye and Adom.
